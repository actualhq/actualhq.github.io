## Giga Models for School Connectivity

You can find the python library containing Giga models [here](https://github.com/actualhq/giga).

## Notebooks

The simplest way to get started with using Giga models is to use one of the tutorial notebooks. For examples of using the Giga model end-to-end, see [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/actualhq/actualhq.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/giga-run-sample.ipynb). For examples of configuring and running individual model blocks see [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/actualhq/actualhq.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/giga-tutorial.ipynb).
